# ABOUT

good2meet is a web app that I created with my friend <a href="https://github.com/PolaZwardon">Pola</a>. You can use our app for meeting new people, sharing hobbies, spending time together. This repository contains only the back-end code of the app. You can check out the front-end code, created in React Js <a href="https://github.com/PolaZwardon/ActivitiesAppFront">here</a>
To build the app we used many various tools:

- ASP.NET CORE 3.1
- MSSQL
- Entity Framework Core
- Automapper
- JWT Authentication 

We implemented the Depedency Injection desing pattern, features like SMTP mail sender for account registration, password hashing and salting. Also we tested endpoints with Postman, and created API documentation with Swagger.

# FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

Our plans for further development are:

- Implement account registration with Google account
- Implement geolocalization
